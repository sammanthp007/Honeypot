# Project 10 - Honeypot

Time spent: **X** hours spent in total

> Objective: Setup a honeypot and provide a working demonstration of its features.

### Required: Overview & Setup

- [ ] A basic writeup (250-500 words) on the `README.md` desribing the overall approach, resources/tools used, findings
- [ ] A specific, reproducible honeypot setup, ideally automated. There are several possibilities for this:
	- A Vagrantfile or Dockerfile which provisions the honeypot as a VM or container
	- A bash script that installs and configures the honeypot for a specific OS
	- Alternatively, **detailed** notes added to the `README.md` regarding the setup, requirements, features, etc.

### Required: Demonstration

- [ ] A basic writeup of the attack (what offensive tools were used, what specifically was detected by the honeypot)
- [ ] An example of the data captured by the honeypot (example: IDS logs including IP, request paths, alerts triggered)
- [ ] A screen-cap of the attack being conducted
    
### Optional: Features
- Honeypot
	- [ ] HTTPS enabled (self-signed SSL cert)
	- [ ] A web application with both authenticated and unauthenticated footprint
	- [ ] Database back-end
	- [ ] Custom exploits (example: intentionally added SQLI vulnerabilities)
	- [ ] Custom traps (example: modified version of known vulnerability to prevent full exploitation)
	- [ ] Custom IDS alert (example: email sent when footprinting detected)
	- [ ] Custom incident response (example: IDS alert triggers added firewall rule to block an IP)
- Demonstration
	- [ ] Additional attack demos/writeups
	- [ ] Captured malicious payload
	- [ ] Enhanced logging of exploit post-exploit activity (example: attacker-initiated commands captured and logged)

I will use Modern Honey Network honeypot since it makes deploying and managing
secure honeypots extremely simple. I followed th instructions as mentioned in
the assignment page itself using HNS:

There a lots of resources online available in setting up a honeypot, but it can
be a bit confusing to know where to start. The Modern Honey Network (MHN)
provides a streamlined approach to setting up a low-interaction honeypot. To
get you started, the following instructions walk through a local setup of an
MHN server/honeypot using Vagrant. Instructions are adapted from the MHN wiki.
You need to have Vagrant installed with a VM provider such as VirtualBox.

On Your Host Machine
Start by cloning the MHN source and launching via Vagrant:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/threatstream/mhn.git
$ cd mhn
$ vagrant up
```

This should create two VMs:

honeypot - the honeypot VM, aka the target
server - the VM running the admin console for monitoring data collected by the honeypot
Verify the two VMs are up and running:

```
$ vagrant global-status
id       name     provider   state    directory
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
924087e  server   virtualbox running  /Users/user/week9/mhn
e91f356  honeypot virtualbox running  /Users/user/week9/mhn

```
Confirm the IP addresses of each. The values below are statically assigned in the Vagrant file, so your output should match the below:

```
$ vagrant ssh server -c "hostname -I | cut -d' ' -f2" 2>/dev/null
# 10.254.254.100
$ vagrant ssh honeypot -c "hostname -I | cut -d' ' -f2" 2>/dev/null
# 10.254.254.101
```
Open shell on server:

```
$ vagrant ssh server
```
Inside the server VM
After executing the vagrant ssh server command above, the command prompt will
change to vagrant@mhn-server:~, indicating you're now inside the server VM.
Start by opening a superuser shell and installing git:

```
$ sudo su -
$ apt-get install -y git
```
At this point we need to clone the mhn repo again inside the server vm. Due to an outstanding issue we will need to use a patched fork instead of the primary repo:

```
$ cd /opt/
$ git clone https://github.com/0x7fff9/mhn.git
# Cloning into 'mhn'...
# ...
$ cd mhn
# pwd should now be /opt/mhn
$ git checkout 0x7fff9-encoding_patch
Branch 0x7fff9-encoding_patch set up to track remote branch 0x7fff9-encoding_patch from origin.
Switched to a new branch '0x7fff9-encoding_patch'
```
Now, from /opt/mhn, launch the pre-requisite install scripts:

```
$ cd scripts
# pwd should now be /opt/mhn/scripts
$ ./install_hpfeeds.sh ; ./install_mnemosyne.sh ; ./install_honeymap.sh
```
This will take ~10 mins. After this, check the supervisor process to make it all components were installed

```
$ supervisorctl status
geoloc                           RUNNING    pid 29334, uptime 0:02:22
honeymap                         RUNNING    pid 29335, uptime 0:02:22
hpfeeds-broker                   RUNNING    pid 10253, uptime 0:07:33
mnemosyne                        RUNNING    pid 28222, uptime 0:06:09
```
Important: Since this is a private network deployment, you need to change a mnemosyne config option to support this. In the server vm, edit /opt/mnemosyne/mnemosyne.cfg and change ignore_rfc1918 to False:

```
[normalizer]
ignore_rfc1918 = False
```
Now restart mnemosyne and run the final server install script:

```
$ supervisorctl restart mnemosyne
# pwd should still be /opt/mhn/scripts
$ ./install_mhnserver.sh
```
The script will prompt you for values (choose whatever you like for Superuser password, otherwise blank indicates default):

```
Do you wish to run in Debug mode?: y/n n
Superuser email: YOUR-EMAIL@YOUR-SITE.com
Superuser password:
Superuser password: (again):
Server base url ["http://1.2.3.5"]: http://10.254.254.100
Honeymap url ["http://1.2.3.5:3000"]: http://10.254.254.100:3000
Mail server address ["localhost"]:
Mail server port [25]:
Use TLS for email?: y/n y
Use SSL for email?: y/n y
Mail server username [""]:
Mail server password [""]:
Mail default sender [""]:
Path for log file ["/var/log/mhn/mhn.log"]:
```
The script will complete in about ~10 mins. When it completes, exit the superuser shell and the server VM by running the exit command twice to return to your host machine:

```
root@mhn-server:/opt/mhn/scripts# exit
# logout
vagrant@mhn-server:~$ exit
# logout
# Connection to 127.0.0.1 closed.
```

## On Your Host Machine
Access the MHN admin console via a browser at http://10.254.254.100 and login with the email / password you specified in the previous step.

Click around to familiarize yourself with the interface.

Go to the Deploy page and in the Select Script input, select Ubuntu - Dionaea and copy the Deploy Command snippet to your clipboard. Dionaea is a low-interaction honeypot designed to trap malware (though we'll just look at using it to detect port scanning).

Back in the terminal, from your host machine, open a shell into the honeypot VM:

```
$ vagrant ssh honeypot
```
The prompt should change again.

Inside the honeypot VM
Open a superuser shell and execute the deploy command you copied from the browser page:

```
$ sudo su -
# command copied from "Deploy Command"
$ wget "http://10.254.254.100/api/script/?text=true&script_id=2" -O deploy.sh && sudo bash deploy.sh http://10.254.254.100 DuGSk2KT
```
The script will run for a few minutes and will eventually prompt you twice with File to Patch: to which you should supply the following values, respectively:

* /etc/dionaea/dionaea.conf
* /usr/lib/dionaea/python/dionaea/ihandlers.py

```
The text leading up to this was:
--------------------------
|--- /etc/dionaea/dionaea.conf
|+++ /etc/dionaea/dionaea.conf.new
--------------------------
File to patch: /etc/dionaea/dionaea.conf

...

The text leading up to this was:
--------------------------
|
|--- /usr/lib/dionaea/python/dionaea/ihandlers.py
|+++ /usr/lib/dionaea/python/dionaea/ihandlers.py.new
--------------------------
File to patch: /usr/lib/dionaea/python/dionaea/ihandlers.py
```
When it completes, exit the superuser shell and the honeypot VM by running the exit command twice to return to your host machine:

```
root@mhn-honeypot:~# exit
logout
vagrant@mhn-honeypot:~$ exit
logout
Connection to 127.0.0.1 closed.
```
## On Your Host Machine
Now, in the browser, go to the Sensors page and you should see mhn-honeypot-dionaea listed.

Check out the Attacks page next; you should see no data...yet.

## Attack!
Let's try a simple attack against the honeypot VM using nmap to see how it is detected.

- [x] You could stage the attack from your host machine or your Kali container or VM, which may already have nmap installed (in which case, skip the setup step).

### Setup

For simplicity's sake, we'll attack from the server VM (if you're running Windows, this may be the easiest way to get nmap installed). Starting from the host, open a Vagrant shell into the server VM and install nmap via apt:

```
$ vagrant ssh server
vagrant@mhn-server:~$ sudo apt-get install -y nmap
```

### Attack with nmap

Run a scan against the honeypot VM using nmap:

```
vagrant@mhn-server:~$ nmap -sV -P0 10.254.254.101

Starting Nmap 5.21 ( http://nmap.org ) at 2017-04-08 18:55 UTC
```
Leave nmap running and go back to the Attacks page in the console. You should see evidence of the nmap scan appearing in the console.

Output:
```

```
